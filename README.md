# planer_shader_webgl
A planer shader that renders without an sphere

Basically, it uses for now a very old Pixi.js version (I rescued this code from an old server I had). 

Tha shader renders in a squared poligon.

Just open the index.html, but be aware that your browser may not allow the webgl context to load files from localhost. Better if you create an http server for serving the files.
